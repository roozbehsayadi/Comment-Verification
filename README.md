# Comment Verification with Machine Learning

According to Wikipedia, "**Machine learning (ML)** is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead". In this project, we have a data set consisting of comments of an online shopping website in Iran (Digikala), and our goal is to be able to determine wheter a comment should be shown on the product's page or not.

The algorithm used in this project is called *Naive Bayes*. It simply uses the Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of a comment being spam, based on some prior knowledges on it's words.

There are two programs in the repository. In "Comment Verification Without learning libraries.ipynb", I implemented this concept from scratch. in "Comment Verification with learning libraries.ipynb", I implemented the algorithm with *sklearn* library. Also, there are some other files in the repository:

- **CommentJudge.jar** - put your answers in a file named ans.csv, and run this jar file to see your accuracy. 
- **ham_frequencies.csv** and **spam_frequencies.csv** - these files are generated by running the "Comment Verification Without learning libraries.ipynb". Generating these files takes so much time (about 6 hours on my laptop) so I put them here to avoid time waste. You can load these files into your program, by running respective cells. Run the cells cautious cause you may overwrite these files. 
- **requirements.txt** - If you are familiar with python, you know that this file helps running the program without version conflict problems in the libraries. 
- **stop_words** - These are some persian stop words I used to improve my accuracy.
- **test.csv** and **train.csv** - These are data sets for learning phase. 

If you want to implement your own approache, pay attention that you have to put your outputs in a file named ans.csv. This file should have two columns. First column's name is id, and it contains the id of the comment in one row. Second column is verification_status, and it shows wheter the comment in one row is spam or ham.
